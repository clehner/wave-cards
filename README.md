# Wave-Cards
This Wave gadget is a JavaScript application that provides a simulation of
playing cards, allowing you to move and manipulate them in real-time. You can
use it to play games with your friends on Apache Wave.

See also [RTC-Cards](https://github.com/clehner/rtc-cards) for a standalone
rewrite using WebRTC.
